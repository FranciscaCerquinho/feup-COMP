### GLOBAL Grade of the project: 18?????

## SUMMARY: 

(Describe what your tool does and its main features.)

Our application consists in the construction of a compiler for programs in the yal language .
The compiler generate valid JVM (Java Virtual Machine) instructions to jasmin, a tool to generate Java bytecodes given assembly programs with JVM instructions.

## EXECUTE: 

Run in the command line:

* Located in the src folder of the project
* jjtree parserGrammar.jjt
* javacc parserGrammar.jj
* javac *.java
* java parserGrammar MyFirstYalExamples/< nameOfFile > or java parserGrammar MyFirstYalExamples_1/< nameOfFile >

## DEALING WITH SYNTACTIC ERRORS: 
(Describe how the syntactic error recovery of your tool does work. Does it exit after the first error?)

## SEMANTIC ANALYSIS: 
(Refer the semantic rules implemented by your tool.)

## INTERMEDIATE REPRESENTATIONS (IRs): 
(for example, when applicable, briefly describe the HLIR (high-level IR) and the LLIR (low-level IR) used, if your tool includes an LLIR with structure different from the HLIR)

Penso que não temos que ter este campo, pq não temos nenhuma representação intermédia, que dizem??

## CODE GENERATION: 
(when applicable, describe how the code generation of your tool works and identify the possible problems your tool has regarding code generation.)

## OVERVIEW: 
(refer the approach used in your tool, the main algorithms, the third-party tools and/or packages, etc.)

## TESTSUITE AND TEST INFRASTRUCTURE: 
(Describe the content of your testsuite regarding the number of examples, the approach to automate the test, etc.)

## TASK DISTRIBUTION: 
(Identify the set of tasks done by each member of the project.)

## PROS: 
(Identify the most positive aspects of your tool)


## CONS: 
(Identify the most negative aspects of your tool)
